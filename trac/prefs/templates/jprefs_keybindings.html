        This site provides keyboard shortcuts for faster access to
        certain functions of this site. As these shortcuts can cause
        conflicts with shortcuts provided by the desktop system or web
        browser, they are disabled by default. See
        <a href="${href}">TracAccessibility</a>
        for more information on access keys.
